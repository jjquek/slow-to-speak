# How I planned the plan

So I've got [the basic idea for the project down.](../functional-spec/overview.md) How do I start?

This is how I went about doing coming up with the plan I had as of 17.10.22, which is when I started to go full-speed ahead with 'the journey'.

Here's my problem

>How can I plan well despite having limited knowledge?

I know I want to build a full-stack application. But, my lack of experience means my *estimations* are likely to be unreliable.

## Unreliable Estimations

Planning involves a lot of estimating-- estimating what tasks will be involved, how difficult they will be, how long they'll take, what they'll achieve, whether they're gonna help with your goals,... 

Stressful. If you're a noob at something (and I am a full-stack noob), you won't be very good at all those kinds of estimations. Let's call this **the problem of noob estimation**.

>**The Problem of Noob Estimation**: You're a noob and so your planning is noob

So, how should I start? I could just start without much of a plan...but that sounds like a recipe for chaos. But, if I make a plan, it probably won't be very good. 

## Problem Decomposition

One thing my practice for coding interviews has taught me is something I'll call **problem decomposition**. (It might actually be called that, idk.) It involves solving a problem by:
1. Breaking it down into sub-problems that are less complex. 
2. Solving those sub-problems
3. Using those solutions to derive a solution to the main problem

And after some reflection, I thought maybe that's how I could approach this project. It also harmonises well with developing a product in iterations. Each iteration, I aim to solve some less complex sub-problem of the overall project. With the knowledge that gives me, I can get better at devising a solution to the original problem.

The upshot is that I will not only be developing but also *planning in iterations*. The more I solve, the more I'll plan. Solve, plan, repeat.

### Decomposing Slow To Speak

I know that STS is something like a social media platform. I also know that it's like a blogging platform. So, maybe I can think of building (and *understanding*) those sorts of platforms as stepping stones. And that seems feasible-- tutorials on building social media or blog apps *abound* on the internet.

But before I just dive in, there's one more thing I should clarify: **what are my aims and why?**
