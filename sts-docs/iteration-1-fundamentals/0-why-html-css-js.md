# Why Not Just Learn The Frameworks?


## HTML & CSS & Javascript

You might be thinking I'm like this:

<center>
    <a href="https://imgflip.com/i/6wsn98">
        <img src="https://i.imgflip.com/6wsn98.jpg" width="40%" title="made at imgflip.com"/>
    </a>
    <div>
        <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator">from Imgflip Meme Generator</a>
    </div>
</center>

But no.  

Rather, the aim is to **learn the fundamental technologies that undergird both front-end and back-end frameworks**.

And that is because of two other aims:

### Decouple From The Actual Stack

I think I know what I'm going to use for the actual project: `React`, `Typescript`, and `Tailwind CSS`. I'll try to justify that choice in writing once the next iteration comes around.

But, even if that's a good choice, I don't want to be tightly coupled to those tools. 

So, I've decided to spend time familiarising myself with the underlying tools that alternative frameworks are built on.  

(Caveat: I may play around with `Typescript` in this iteration since I intend to use it as much as possible over `Javascript`. But in this iteration the focus will be on learning the core concepts of `Javascript` that also ultimately bear on `Typescript`.)

### The Less Magic The Better

That first aim relates to my second aim. I was actually working on a bootcamp recently where we were using `React` and `Tailwind` to build some applications. However, the way we skipped over learning `HTML` and `CSS` properly and went straight to the frameworks ended up bothering me. Here's why:

A framework is a packaged set of code--abstractions--that you can invoke to call some other code--the stuff 'underneath' you don't see which is doing all the work. (That's my gut definition of a framework; it probably fails but, whatever.) 

There's always a balance needed in software engineering between [trusting abstractions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDEA8bTAHz8) and understanding how things work. In my case, because my [top goal](higher-order-aims.md) is to *learn*, I'm placing the accent on understanding how things work. Therefore, I think it's sensible to devote a good chunk of time to working with the basic tools before the frameworks.

Instead of offering my own justification for this, let me quote [from an instructor I'm learning from,](https://www.udemy.com/user/anthonypalicea/)

> ...those that learn purely by example, and not by understanding, end up much more limited than they need to be. <br /> <br /> "Examples need to be built on top of context, and once you have context, you can not only copy the examples you find, but adjust and improve upon them." 

## The Template

In [a previous note](../iteration-0-planning-the-plan/1-higher-order-aims.md), I mentioned that in each iteration I will seek to answer a set of questions and specify some 'mini-deliverables' to complete. These mini deliverables should involve solving some smaller version of the larger problem I'm trying to solve, which is `Slow To Speak` itself. (See the link for elaboration.)

Unlike subsequent iterations, I don't think there's much 'meta-learning' to be done on which tool to use. HTML, CSS, and Javascript simply are the core tools underlying much of web development.

So, I'll just specify what the mini-deliverable is: **design and deploy a product landing page for `Slow To Speak`**.
