## Fictional User Personas

**Persona 1: Bartholemew.**

Bartholemew is always overflowing. He writes nearly as much as he reads, and he thinks a whole lot more. His many reflections can be found in his Evernote, as well as via imposition on his mates' eardrums while they're grinding League together. Desparate to silence him, they encourage Bart to start a blog. Unfortunately, he's a bit of a shy type. He'd prefer to share his ideas in a more intimate and familiar setting.

He has a bunch of other nerd-friends who he loves to discuss things with, but they're also recluses and never leave their rooms. He would bomboard his instagram feed with his musings, but he feels constrained by the limitations of the editor.

**Persona 2: Bethany**

Bethany is an aspiring academic, but a tech-savy one. She wants to do what all blossoming graduate students wish to: publish, publish, publish. She could use `Overleaf`, `Word`, `Google Docs`, and email, but that's what her profs are using too. She wants to use something that's more her vibe~-- young, modern, and ~slick. She wants that all with the ease of building up her ideas within her ivory tower crew. But, she's unlikely to persuade all of them to sign up for some unfamiliar software service, so she's got to do it with just their emails...

**Persona 3: Chad**

Everyone else on this list has `I*` for their MBTI, but not Chad. He wouldn't strike you as the pensive sort, but sometimes, he launches into the most random of musings on his Instagram 'Close Friends' stories. He actually thinks a lot, but you'll never engage him on that level unless you catch him at the club. Deep down, he would actually love to have a space to more regularly invite his friends into his thoughts, whilst still being known as 'Chad'.
