# Slow To Speak - Functional Specification

## Overview

> `Slow To Speak` is a service for users to develop and publish their ideas *through* inner circles.

Woah, there's a lot going on there. And what happened to the phrase 'collaborative thought development'? 

STS is a platform for collaborative thought development. But like any other schamcy product tagline, it stands in need of definition. That's what I'm going to try and do in this overview.

There are two main ideas in the quote above. Users:
* 'develop and publish their ideas'
* '*through* inner circles'

### The Core Idea

Let's look at a picture:

Think of it as something like a social media platform.

You have a private account. You can make posts which only your 'followers' or 'friends' can see. These 'followers' can tell you what they think via 'comments'. 

It's like that on `Slow To Speak` (**STS** from here on), but with some differences.

**For each post**, you can organise your followers into a pipeline that is structured like a bunch of **concentric circles**. Your post gets *developed* (maybe) as you receive input from your followers. It eventually gets published (if you want) after being *pushed through* each circle, starting with an 'inner-most' circle.

This isn't quite like `Instagram`'s 'close friends' feature. Each pipeline (or set of concentric circles) is *post-specific*. Follower A could be in the first circle for Post X, but in the outer circle for Post Y. You can set up some default circles to pick from for each post, or construct a specific one while you're making that post.

### Toy Example

Let's say you have just 2 followers, Alice and Bob. You are about to make a post that's entitled, `Hot Take Of The Day`. Gratefully, instead of immmediately polluting the public space with rash nonsense, you opt to push it through a particular pipeline. Stage 1 (or inner circle 1) includes Alice, and Stage 2 (inner circle 2) includes Bob *and Alice* (i.e., Alice can still see the post). 

Your post gets pushed to Stage 1, Alice gets notified, and she comes back with, 'Don't be ridiculous. Plus, your argument commits logical fallacy $x$'.' Bitter, but rational, you concede that Alice is right and refine your post with more nuance. Alice then comments that she thinks your point is interesting now that it's been refined. Elated, you push it to Stage 2, and Bob gets notified. Bob thinks it's great too, and you decide to push it outside the inner circles into the wild; it's now visible on your public feed.

Next time, you could have Bob view a post before Alice.

### Collaborative Thought Development

The example is contrived, and who's to say my followers won't just be part of my echo chamber, but hopefully the idea is clear. 

Your `Hot Take Of The Day` was *developed* and eventually *published through* inner circles of your followers. 

In other words, your followers *collaborated* with you to *develop* your *thoughts* into something brighter and more value-adding to the world.

> Terminological Aside: 'Followers' are going to be called 'Thought Partners' on STS. Maybe.

You could say you were *slow to speak* as a result of going through your friends.

But, who would want to use a platform like this?
