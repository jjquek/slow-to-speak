# Slow To Speak - Functional Specification

## Overview

*Slow To Speak* is a service for users to develop and publish their ideas in writing within inner circles.

A first approximation of what the service offers can be gotten by thinking of it like a social media platform.

Much like in with a private account in a social media service, each user can make posts to their feed which only 'followers' or 'friends' can see. These 'followers' can provide input in the form of 'comments' or 'likes'. What makes *Slow To Speak* (**STS** from here on) **distinctive** from tradiitional socia media platforms are **the principles it embodies**, as well as **the social activity** it seeks to promote. Considering these will help one to understand what motivates the varius features it includes on top/in place of the traditional social media platform.

However, instead of beginning with the abstract, we will start from the concrete-- what kind of users is STS hoping to cater to?
