This functional specification for *Slow To Speak* is a work in progress. The wording will need continual revision before finalization. 

All graphics or layouts are merely illustrative; the actual feel and look of the site will develop over time.

Morever, this project is primarily a training exercise for me to develop full-stack development chops. So, please ignore the failings I will probably have on other aspects of providing a SaaS (e.g. product development, market research)...

The inspiration for doing this came from [this guy](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/10/02/painless-functional-specifications-part-1-why-bother/).
