### Social Activity : Collaborative Thought Development

Let's become with the less abstract of the two. 

Traditional social media platforms ... well, who knows what they're trying to do nowadays, right? 

STS seeks to promote **collaborative thought development**. I made the phrase up, but the idea is mundane: many people thinking hard about something together.

Thinking is hard. But it's important. Writing is one way to make it easier. Instead of trying to hold and mold everything in your head, you can spill out the mess of your thoughts onto a page or editor. That way, you've freed up some cognitive effort you can use to evaluate what you've outputted. 

Unfortunately, this is something that traditional social media and even blogging platforms don't help us do so well. We're usually given an editor of some sort, and it goes straight out to the public. Feeds are full of half-baked and unthoughtful ideas. Sure, we can often delete what we've put out before (thank God!), but often that doesn't happen soon enough, or at all! And that's often because of another issue.

When you have 'followers' or 'friends' in the order of the 100s, you'd be lucky to have even a tenth of those
