# Features

At a very high level, I outline the features of the application here. The details will be incrementally ironed out in the [user flow](4-user-flow.md) and [screen-by-screen](5-screen-by-screen.md) sections.

## Core Features

* `STS` is structured much like a social media platform. 
  * Users have
    * private and public posts
      * tagged / untagged
    * followers
    * a feed to view the posts of others
    * a notification feed that (can be) linked to their emails
    * the ability to comment on other posts.
* `STS`'s arguably **distinctive** feature is the post-specific *pipelines* that can be constructed.

## Other Features

* A custom, feature-rich text editor (beyond just a simple MD or WYSIWG editor)
* A range of possible forms of feedback (e.g. embedding polls in posts for viewers to respond to, inline comments)
* Dashboard analytics for users to ask all sorts of queries related to their own activity and that of their followers
