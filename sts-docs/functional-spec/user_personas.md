## User Personas

<!-- NOTE : I think it's better to include the personas here so that it's easier to appreciate what the app seeks to do. -->

**Persona 1: Bartholemew.**

Bartholemew is always overflowing. He writes nearly as much as he reads, and he thinks a whole lot more. His many reflections can be found in his Evernote, as well as via imposition on his mates' eardrums while they're grinding League together. Desparate to silence him, they encourage Bart to start a blog. Unfortunately, he's a bit of a shy type. He'd prefer to share his ideas in a more intimate and familiar setting.

He has a bunch of other nerd-friends who he loves to discuss things with, but they're also recluses and never leave their rooms. He would bomboard his instagram feed with his musings, but he feels constrained by the limitations of the editor.

<!-- TODO : do I need to identify how the app would solve his problem here? I don't think so. -->

**Persona 2: Bethany**

Not the town. Bethany is an academic.

**Persona 3: ColdShowers**

<!-- something for the aspiring tech bro. -->

**Persona 4: Introspective Chad**

<!-- the least eccentric of the lot -->
