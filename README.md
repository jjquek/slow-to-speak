## About The Project üìö

Despite having learnt a lot from [my time at Imperial](https://github.com/jjquek), I never had the chance to  build a full-stack application end-to-end myself.

This project is intended primarily as an *exercise to learn* how to do that. 

This emphasis on learning shapes the plan I have. As you can see from the [Roadmap](#roadmap-üöó) below, I'm not developing the product 'scrum' or 'Agile' style. Nonetheless, I've tried to plan things in a way to avoid the trap of 'tutorial hell'. 

You can read all about that plan [in my notes on what I've termed 'Iteration 0: Planning The Plan'](sts-docs/iteration-0-planning-the-plan/0-noob-estimation.md)

## Roadmap üöó

* [x] **Iteration 0:** [Planning The Plan](sts-docs/iteration-0-planning-the-plan/0-noob-estimation.md)
  * finished 16.10.2022
* [ ] **Iteration 1:** [Fundamentals Of Web Dev](sts-docs/iteration-1-fundamentals/0-why-html-css-js.md)
  * from 17.10.2022 - 26.10.2022
* [ ] **Iteration 2:** Focusing On Front-End Frameworks and Issues
  * from 27.10.2022 - 09.11.2022
* [ ] **Iteration 3:** Focusing on Back-End Frameworks and Issues + MVP Development
  * from 10.11.2022 - 25.11.2022
* [ ] **Iteration 4:** tbd.

For each iteration, I plan to document my plan, the rationale for the plan, and also include some reflections at the end.

## Why All The Writing?

It might seem strange I've spent quite a bit of time writing about my thought processes, especially before any code has been entered into the repo ü§° . Here's why:

[This guy](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/10/02/painless-functional-specifications-part-1-why-bother/) and [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0AHyWCB2O4) convinced me that taking time to write a spec is really worth while.

While developers can't replace programs with prose, writing can you:
* clarify, refine and express your own ideas, which helps you
* communicate your intentions to others better, which could help you
* communicate with your team better, especially when you work in a big team

Even before I land a job, there's an immediate application: people I ask for feedback can know and critique my thought processes more easily. (Hi Mom.)

I'm also hoping these writings will form a narrative that can help others who want to embark on a similar journey.

<!-- ## Acknowledgements üíØ

* The name of the project comes from a verse in the Bible: James 1:19. 

> My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, **slow to speak** and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.

In context, the verse is not about making thoughtful posts. But I got the name from this verse anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

* My many intelligent friends and family whom I am talking to about the idea in both its technical and non-technical aspects.
