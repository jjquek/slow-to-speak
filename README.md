## About The Project üìö

Despite having learnt a lot from [my time at Imperial](https://github.com/jjquek), I never had the chance to  build a full-stack application end-to-end myself.

This project is intended primarily as an *exercise to learn* how to do that. 

## Why All The Writing?

Here's why:

[This guy](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/10/02/painless-functional-specifications-part-1-why-bother/) and [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0AHyWCB2O4) convinced me that taking time to write a spec is really worth while.

While developers can't replace programs with prose, writing can you:
* clarify, refine and express your own ideas, which helps you
* communicate your intentions to others better, which could help you
* communicate with your team better, especially when you work in a big team

I'm also hoping these writings will form a narrative that can help others who want to embark on a similar journey. 

## Contact üëã

If you'd like to chat about the project more or give some suggestions, reach out via

<!-- ## Acknowledgements üíØ

* The name of the project comes from a verse in the Bible: James 1:19. 

> My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, **slow to speak** and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.

In context, the verse is not about making thoughtful posts. But I got the name from this verse anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

* My many intelligent friends and family whom I am talking to about the idea in both its technical and non-technical aspects.
